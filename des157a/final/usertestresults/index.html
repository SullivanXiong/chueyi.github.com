                    <h2>Observations</h2>
                        <p>The main issue that all three users noted was the lack of a restart button at the end of the Mad Lib. They wanted to return to the starting screen without having to actually hit the restart button. They spent more time than necessary looking for a button to reset and then had to awkwardly aim the cursor to hit the reset button.<br>
                            <img src = "images/urvi.JPG" alt = "urvi">
                                <figcaption>Here is Urvi experiencing my design. Nice!</figcaption>
                        </p>

                        <p>The Mad Lib script that is written at the end of the experience needs to have some sizing, spacing, and adjustments to make it look more legible. Urvi noted that the story should have a title because she didn’t know it was a Mad Lib or the final part of the experience until she stopped and read the story.<br>
                            <img src = "images/jackie.JPG" alt = "jackie">
                                <figcaption>Jackie working hard on flowing through "Your Squid Game"! Bravo!</figcaption>
                        </p>

                        <p>My users advised that I implement more animations and transformations for the characters and other elements when actions are executed or on hover to make the site more lively. Perhaps the most notable advice I received to make the story very interactable and replayable is to change the outcome of the story if certain characters are clicked.<br>
                            <img src = "images/badaal.JPG" alt = "badaal">
                                <figcaption>Look at Badaal absorbing those characters! Great!</figcaption>
                        </p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                        <p>After absorbing these observations and comments here and there for improvement, I am definitely going to include them. I’ve already programmed the hard parts so now is the time for polishing and making the site more fluid and dynamic. I will give the buttons the same hover behavior as the character selection to make it more of an interactable item. I am definitely going to implement a restart button. Making the MadLib more story-like may be the most tricky part of enhancing the site because I may have to do a design overhaul for that section. Having the characters affect the outcome of the story may also be a deceptively hard task. </p>

                <p class = "paragraphcontent">“Who is Playing the Guqin” is one of the greatest interactive media sites I’ve ever come across and will be using for my final project inspiration. The website has a unique painterly style that evokes traditional Chinese aesthetics. One key aspect about this site is that there are hardly any geometric shapes which makes it identifiable. It takes you through a mountainous journey with a character that elegantly jumps from mountaintop to mountaintop and even has a river section which changes the perspective of the interaction.</p>
                    
                <p class = "paragraphcontent">I cannot read Chinese but the icons and hand gestures that are present on the screen makes it user friendly to navigate, but I cannot truly understand the purpose of the website. This made me realize the importance of including symbols and icons here and there to guide users. The website needs a realignment of some of the buttons that prompts the interactive events to start up because it took a while for me to notice them. The monochromatism of the website also didn’t make it easy to point out the buttons. </p>

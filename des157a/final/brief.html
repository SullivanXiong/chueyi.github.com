            <p>I want to remaster my Mad Libs project because I feel like I didn’t get to flush out all the details and concepts like I originally wanted such as an opening screen, music, character select, and a final story unraveling. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>First Inspiration</h2>
                    
                <p class = "paragraphcontent">“Who is Playing the Guqin” is one of the greatest interactive media sites I’ve ever come across and will be using for my final project inspiration. The website has a unique painterly style that evokes traditional Chinese aesthetics. One key aspect about this site is that there are hardly any geometric shapes which makes it identifiable. It takes you through a mountainous journey with a character that elegantly jumps from mountaintop to mountaintop and even has a river section which changes the perspective of the interaction.</p>
                    
                <p class = "paragraphcontent">I cannot read Chinese but the icons and hand gestures that are present on the screen makes it user friendly to navigate, but I cannot truly understand the purpose of the website. This made me realize the importance of including symbols and icons here and there to guide users. The website needs a realignment of some of the buttons that prompts the interactive events to start up because it took a while for me to notice them. The monochromatism of the website also didn’t make it easy to point out the buttons. </p>

                <div class = "imghoverdiv">
                    <a href = "https://pvp.qq.com/act/6749/a20210927pf/index.html" class = "imghover">
                            <img src = "images/guqinscreenshot.jpg" alt = "guqinwebsite"> 
                            <h3>Who is Playing the Guqin</h3>   
                    </a>
                </div>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>Second Inspiration</h2>
                    
                <p class = "paragraphcontent">“De Bijenkorf” is a remarkable website that takes the user through a journey in the woods as a bee while using stop points to exhibit their fashion items. The whole experience feels ethereal and the sound effects that change as you progress through the forest is fantastic. The beautiful visuals can speak for itself and everything flows very smoothly as if you were going through an animating book.</p>
                    
                <p class = "paragraphcontent">I wish that there was a description of what the company is and/or what the journey is about because I originally thought that it was a game and it took me a while to realize that the bee that we control through the woods is taking us to the displays of fashion goods. I will perhaps incorporate a scroll feature in my remastered Mad Libs project to unveil the story. I am definitely going to include sound and De Bijenkorf surely showed me how you can improve the experience with it.  </p>

                <div class = "imghoverdiv">
                    <a href = "https://admireamaze.debijenkorf.nl/" class = "imghover">
                            <img src = "images/bijenkorfscreenshot.jpg" alt = "bijenkorfwebsite"> 
                            <h3>De Bijenkorf</h3>   
                    </a>
                </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Incorporation</h2>
                <p>Since both websites have a journey and narrative base, I am going to borrow the scroll and interactive elements from “Who is Playing the Guqin” and “De Bijenkorf” since Mad Libs is about stories. The narrative is tailored to what you input in the text box so I’m not too sure how I will incorporate the user’s words into the story. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Design Strategy</h2>
                <p>I am going to implement 16-bit graphics and make music using a chipwave synthesizer just like I did for my Game On project. The fundamentals I learned from Game On gave me the skills and knowledge to upgrade Mad Libs like I originally intended. I am going to include an opening screen that exhibits the logo and the rules so that the users can properly be introduced to the site. The next screen will have a character select screen featuring characters from the Squid Game show and this will play a role later. After this, the usual text inputs will be displayed so the user can tailor their story. Instead of having a character move on the screen as the text boxes are filled, I will have the page scroll and the characters will run across the screen and unravel the story that the user created then the iconic doll will be at the end of the story so that the users can click on her and restart the experience. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Integration</h2>
            <p>Javascript will play a very heavy role in this for programming the music, hiding/showing elements, and progressing the screens. The CSS will be tricky too since I intend for one page to be very long for unveiling the story. </p>

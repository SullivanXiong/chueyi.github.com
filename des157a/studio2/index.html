                                <h3>Completed November 16, 2020</h3>
                            <p>The first illustration was inspired by Yohji Yamamoto’s fashion. His work is avant garde and draws inspiration from the heaviness, modesty, and silhouette of Japanaese garments. This outfit includes a wide brim hat and a long dress that is heavily draped with an extended scarf that hangs around the body. This dress is intended for parties and events that don't require a lot of moving. </p>

                                <h3>Completed December 4, 2020</h3>
                            <p>The second illustration consists of a black bikini with my signature layered with a chiffon jacket and pants then finished with high heels. A pair of shades and purse are added to accessorise and complement the look. This was inspired after listening to Zhu’s second studio album, “Ringo’s Desert” themed after deserts, obviously. I wanted this outfit to be fashionable, yet comfortable for hot environments. In addition, black is a desired color to cool down in the desert. </p>

                                <h3>Completed December 6, 2020</h3>
                            <p>This look is the result of texturizing sound. Again, this outfit was inspired after listening to Zhu’s music; this time, I listened to his single, “Dreams” which has a very dark atmosphere and malicious tone. When I listen to that song, I think of black, spikes, and odd shapes. In addition, the outfit was inspired after one of my assignments from the course, Form and Color, which tasked me to create an interesting composition with only black ellipses.</p>

                                <h3>Completed December 21, 2020</h3>
                            <p>The Royalty outfit consists of a dress that has kimono style sleeves with a shorter skirt and knee high boots. A silver crown and a Hmong inspired necklace was drawn to complement the entire outfit. The highlight of the uniform are the patterns. The patterns were inspired by merging Hmong flower patterns and French royalty patterns. This is significant because the French have a history of oppressing and colonizing Laos which in turn affected the Hmong people during the 1900s and still has lasting effects. I intended this to juxtapose the clash of these two cultures.   </p>

                                <h3>Completed December 23, 2020</h3>
                            <p>This uniform was drawn by merging street fashion and Japanese creatures; specifically, I merged the fashion subculture, techwear, and onis. The outfit is composed of a horned bucket hat, a crop top, shorts, a large jacket, a utility belt, thigh high socks, and sneakers. The notable oni jaw, armored shoulder pads, and large prayer beads were used to accessorize the attire. This is what I would imagine a fashionable, armored samurai would look like if they were placed in a modern city.  </p>

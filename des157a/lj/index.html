        <h2>"Who is playing the Guqin" Review</h2>
        <p>October 25, 2021</p>
        <p class = "articles">
            I interacted and analyzed “Who is playing the Guqin” on awwwards.com developed by Senzh. The website is artistically sound and stylistically unique identified by the ink and wash painting. Although I can’t read the Chinese characters, the visual cues still show me what I can do to interact with the page. Some elements included tapping on the screen to make the character move on the mountains to progress the background and holding down the left mouse button while swiping across the screen to reveal the background image. Each ink and water streak across the screen feels invigorating and satisfying while providing a unique and fulfilling experience. The interactivity even changed the point of view by switching from a side scroller to a one point perspective. However, one detrimental aspect of this interactivity was that the start-up rendering took a while and nearly made me leave the page.

        <h2>"Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows" Review</h2>
        <p>October 19, 2021</p>
        <p class = "articles">
            As a user, I do find modals incredibly annoying when they pop without my knowledge so this provided some great insight for making clean and less aggravating modals. It’s nice to finally know the design term for “pop windows” (modals). Showing the anatomy of a modal was definitely helpful for understanding the design elements. It’s quite understandable that modals should only be used sparingly and only when necessary.
        </p>

        <p class = "articles">
            This article brought new and informative knowledge since I didn’t know what modals were called nor how they should be used. I thought modals and how they work were neat, but now I know that they should be utilized only a few times.
        </p>

    <h2>Tips for Modals, Overlays, and Dialog Windows</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Only use modals when you need the user’s input or attention</li>
            <li>Options for escaping a modal: Cancel button, Close button, Escape key, Click outside the window</li>
            <li>Modals should not have scrollbars</li>
            <li>Modals should not be more than 50% of the screen</li>
            <li>Darken the background when a modal pops up</li>
            <li>Try not to use modals on mobile devices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>"Best practices for form design" Review</h2>
            <p>October 16, 2021</p>
            <p class = "articles">
                 As a user, I get pretty irritated when I have to go through a massive form that is clustered, tight spaced, and doesn’t flow well so this was a very eye opening article.
            </p>

            <p class = "articles">
                  The advice for creating a progress bar is pretty great, and I prefer forms that are styled like this because I want to see a visual of my progress and it eases my impatience. The formatting was very informative and made sense to me as a user too; when I create a password then it reloads the page to exclaim that I need more characters can be an annoyance. I always research other ways to make design more accessible for users with disabilities so one aspect I found helpful was the section that advised to use other means of communicating other than color such as adding a “!” before an error message for color blind users.
            </p>

            <p class = "articles">
                One such website that includes some great values of form design is the e-commerce site, <a href = "https://zhumerch.com/" id = "zhu">ZHU Merch</a>. This is because the fields are spaced properly and even has in-line labels, but the labels move places and are still visible for indicating what information is needed while the user inputs characters. When a field is selected, the border bolds to indicate which field you are on which helps with visibility. For a website that primarily utilizes black and white, it is well executed and demonstrates that color is not absolutely essential to create effective forms. Everything flows smoothly and their forms are not difficult to follow.
            </p>

            <p class = "articles">
                All in all, this article addressed issues that I have with forms but never thought about before and taught me how to fix them now that I’m on the side of the designers. 
            </p>

        <h2>Tips for Forms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Have a visual guidance for form filling to lessen impatience</li>
                <li>Use one column at a time</li>
                <li>Specify instructions for input requirements</li>
                <li>Avoid in-line labels; save it for easy inputs such as Username and Password</li>
                <li>Adjust field sizes according to the label</li>
                <li>Use buttons or checkboxes over dropdown menus</li>
                <li>Test the "Tab" button</li>
                <li>Add reason when asking for sensitive information</li>
                <li>Have a "Show" and "Hide" function on password or PIN to prevent future login failure</li>
                <li>Color should not be the only option to communicate. Think about those with disabilities</li>
            </ul>

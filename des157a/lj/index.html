        <h2>Review</h2>
            <p class = "firstarticle">
                 As a user, I get pretty irritated when I have to go through a massive form that is clustered, tight spaced, and doesn’t flow well so this was a very eye opening article.
            </p>

            <p class = "firstarticle">
                  The advice for creating a progress bar is pretty great, and I prefer forms that are styled like this because I want to see a visual of my progress and it eases my impatience. The formatting was very informative and made sense to me as a user too; when I create a password then it reloads the page to exclaim that I need more characters can be an annoyance. I always research other ways to make design more accessible for users with disabilities so one aspect I found helpful was the section that advised to use other means of communicating other than color such as adding a “!” before an error message for color blind users.
            </p>

            <p class = "firstarticle">
                One such website that includes some great values of form design is the e-commerce site, <a href = "https://zhumerch.com/" id = "zhu">ZHU Merch</a>. This is because the fields are spaced properly and even has in-line labels, but the labels move places and are still visible for indicating what information is needed while the user inputs characters. When a field is selected, the border bolds to indicate which field you are on which helps with visibility. For a website that primarily utilizes black and white, it is well executed and demonstrates that color is not absolutely essential to create effective forms. Everything flows smoothly and their forms are not difficult to follow.
            </p>

            <p class = "firstarticle">
                All in all, this article addressed issues that I have with forms but never thought about before and taught me how to fix them now that I’m on the side of the designers.

        <h1>Project Brief</h1>

            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>I want this project to be a haven for Hmong people to discuss their war stories, ghost stories, and the Hmong-American or Hmong-Laotian experience in general for the purpose of sharing and immortalizing Hmong culture which will be designed in a desktop and mobile layout which will be responsive.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Entertainment for ghost stories</li>
                        <li>Act as a haven for discussing the culture</li>
                        <li>Sharing information</li>

                </p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Pattern based</li>
                        <li>Minimal text for design elements</li>
                        <li>User friendly</li>
                        <li>Made to look like an interactable garden</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Water-like effects</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                <p>I want users to feel enlightened and more informed about Hmong culture. If they're already well versed in it then I hope that they gain more insight from reading about stories shared by Hmong people.</p>

            <h2>Users</h2>
                <p>This website will be designed for Hmong people but not exclusively for them. It can also be a resource for people who are versed in Asian studies and would like to gain insight and information.</p>

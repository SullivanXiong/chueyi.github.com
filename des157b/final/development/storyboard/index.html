        <h2 id = "original">Original Idea</h2>
            <p>Cultures around the world have internal issues which may be exclusive to their own or can be empathized by other groups.I intended my website to be a safe haven for people from different cultures to talk about their personal issues and how their cultures should go around to fixing it to heal social justice. I opted to change the topic because this website promotes anonymity but there would be no way to actually verify that a user is from a certain culture which may cause Internet trolling and cyber bullying.</p>

        <h2 id = "second">Second Idea</h2>
            <p>The following idea changed to become more light hearted. This was intended for people to share information about their cultures. It is essentially an informational database so people who are interested in learning more about their own cultures or other groups can participate. My partner and I thought that this was too general and did not provide any unique qualities. I decided to go more towards a global fashion route because my peer and I were ranting about how global fashion and the industry in general has little to no information about garmnets, jewelry, and cosmetics from other cultures.</p>

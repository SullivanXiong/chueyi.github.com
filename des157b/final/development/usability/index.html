            <h2>NAME OF PROJECT</h2>
                <p>(Name of Project) is a safe haven for Hmong people to discuss and share their stories through four selected topics: food, art, war, and ghosts. Hmong culture is slowly dissipating due to Westernization and age, so this was designed to safekeep information and stories about Hmong people and culture for future generations.</p>
                <p>To participate, select write or gallery. “Write” will take you to select one of the topics: food, art, war, or ghosts. After selecting, fill in the boxes then submit. “Gallery” holds all of the submissions made where you can look at work made by others. Select the desired topic and choose which work you would like to view. Please refrain from vulgar language when writing and be mindful of other submitted pieces.</p>

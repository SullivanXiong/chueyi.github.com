        <h2>"How Does Culture Spread" by Bryan Babbs</h2>
            <p>This video produced by Bryan Babbs on Youtube dives into three concepts of how culture is spread on a global scale; these being war, travel, and trade. Bryan Babbs seems to have a history with posting crash courses about history on Youtube so he may have educational credentials. This is a very basic video yet phenomenal explanation for historical dissemination of culture. It was insightful and I hope to incorporate some of its information into the website. </p>

        <h2>“Culture Hearths and Diffusion” by Amanda Britney</h2>
            <p>Amanda Britney from ThoughtCo’s article on the history of cultural dissemination gave me further insight into how cultures spread their knowledge and how central cities still maintain this spread of culture. This will provide me some insight on how culture managed to diffuse so well in the early times and how it can be applied to the final project. It seems like humanity has a natural attraction to other cultures which motivates them to learn more, according to the article. </p>

        <h2>“Simple Ways You Can Share Your Culture” by Stumps & Associates</h2>
            <p>On Stump & Associates, the writer dives into various ways to teach others about your culture. Considering my interactive design is to instruct, this was insightful for breaking into the public and teaching others. This could also act as a guideline for my users when sharing aspects about their culture. It’s also shown me that my interactive design will have to stretch beyond being a social media platform. Stump & Associates is an immigration law firm and their website is designed to assist travelers on a visa so it can be concluded that their information for culture dissemination is genuine and relative to their business values. </p>

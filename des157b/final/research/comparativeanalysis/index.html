                    <p class = "p-compare">Asian Legacy Library is a great starter to opening my eyes for cultural. It flows well and structures the story of its goals and philosophy in an understanable way. In addition, it maintains a modern chic while having an interesting, unique, and dynamic flow of elements. I think I will integrate some of the animations and modern stylizing for my final project.</p>

                <h2 id = "h2-2">Swell Gallery</h2>
                    <p class = "p-compare">Swell Gallery allows 3D artists to submit their 3D work where users can scroll through a carousel to preview their work. When their work is clicked, the interface changes to a 3D room where users can interact and observe the 3D art at a closer perspective. My final project might not include 3D objects but I want to adapt the carousel system that shows individuality of users who input their data into my website. The carousel and the overall look that each piece inputs into the carousel gives it a fresh and new personality.</p>

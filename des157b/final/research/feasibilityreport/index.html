        <h2>Skill Assessment</h2>
            <p>I'd say this is reasonable. I'm comfortable with making illustrations and then incorporating them into the website. I've made websites that require several pages so this is within my comfort zone. In addition, the Javascript shouldn't be too difficult either nor have an extreme prescence (if I'm thinking about the project thoroughly). I'd say that the most trouble I will have is with the Back4App processing. I still don't have a comfortable grasp with this and am hoping that it will execute the functions I need. Since we still have a few weeks, I am confident that I will get it how I want, visually.</p>

            <p>I am not working with a partner.</p>
